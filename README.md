TGT: Tree Guy's Tools

 

A simple in-development mod for enhancing the lawn and leaf care experience in Minecraft.

 
New additions such as:

 

   Splitters: Allows players to automatically turn axed logs directly into planks along with planned features such as a built-in craft assist.
 
   Clippers: Tired of constantly making shears only to collect a hand full of materials? Need a faster more durable way to pick up leafs for your bio fuels? Clippers will be your best friend.
 
   Tier system: Progressive tiers of tools allow accessibility at all stages of game. Different tiers will eventually feature more than just differing stat grades at higher tiers.

 

Developer Notes:

   This mod is still in very early development but has some of its base concepts down. Please leave us feedback!
 
   This mod was mainly inspired to be used in energy-featuring modpacks but I wanted it to be as available as possible for a vanilla enhancement.
 
   Please leave feedback and check regularly for updates!
