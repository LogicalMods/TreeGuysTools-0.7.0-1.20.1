TGT: Tree Guy's Tools


A simple in-development mod for enhancing the lawn and leaf care experience in Minecraft.


New additions:

Splitters: Allows players to automatically turn axed logs directly into planks along with planned features such as a built-in craft assist.
Clippers: Tired of constantly making shears only to collect a hand full of materials? Need a faster more durable way to pick up leafs for your bio fuels? Clippers will be your best friend.
Tier system: Progressive tiers of tools allow accessibility at all stages of game. Different tiers will eventually feature more than just differing stat grades at higher tiers. 
New recipes can be found by mixing logs and leaves with any of the added tools.
New fuel items are in the  game as well, check out the firewood and chopped leaves!

Developer Notes:
This mod is still in very early development but has some of its base concepts down. Please leave us feedback!
This mod was mainly inspired to be used in energy-featuring modpacks but we wanted it to be as available as possible for a vanilla enhancement.
Please leave feedback and check regularly for updates!
